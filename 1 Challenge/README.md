# üìä Alura Store Sales Analysis

Project carried out as part of the Alura Latam Challenge - Data Science. In this challenge, I‚Äôll assist Mr. Juan in deciding which store from his Alura Store chain he should sell in order to launch a new business venture. To make this decision, I‚Äôll analyze sales data, performance metrics, and customer reviews from the four Alura Store branches. The goal is to identify the least efficient store and provide a final, data-driven recommendation.

## üìå Description

### 1. Analyze Store Data
The evaluation of multiple aspects of store performance, including:
- Total revenue
- Best-selling and least-selling product categories.
- Customer ratings and reviews
- Best-selling and least-selling products
- Average delivery performance
- Heat map of selling 

### 2. Create Visualizations
Use data visualizations to present your findings in a clear and engaging way:
- Choose appropriate chart types to communicate your results effectively
- I included different types of charts, such as bar plots, pie charts, heatmap,scatter plot and violin plot.

### 3. Provide a Final Recommendation
Based on the analysis, write a clear and concise recommendation explaining:
- Which store Mr. Juan should sell
- The reasons behind your decision, supported by the data
